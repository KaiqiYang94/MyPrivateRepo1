Which problems did you find in the two models as a result of using LTSA? 
Were these problems also present in the Java implementation? 
If you find problems with the Java solution submitted for part 1a, Solution 2, why do you think you picked these up now and not before submitting the Java code? 
If you did not find problems with your part 1a, Solution 2 submission, were you convinced when you submitted part 1a, Solution 2 that no problems existed? 
Why did you believe this? Do you still believe there are no problems?
